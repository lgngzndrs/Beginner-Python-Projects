# Beginner-Python-Projects
This library was created to make it easier for anyone to create projects while learning Python.


#As the first project, I chose the BMI calculator. Because it is very important to understand and make sense of numerical operations in Python.

footnote:
BMI:Body Mass Index



height = input("enter your height in m :")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg : ")


weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)

BMİ = weight_as_int /height_as_float ** 2

BMİ_as_int =int(BMİ)


print(BMİ)
